# Discord Bot - eMusic
Music bot used on <a href="http://ethereal.network/discord">Ethereal Network's Discord.</a>

There needs to be a youtube.properties file in the same directory as the bot's jar. This file will have a YouTube API developer's token that allows for YouTube searches without links.

Read the <a href="https://grasinga.github.io/eMusic/javadocs/">JavaDocs</a> for more info.
